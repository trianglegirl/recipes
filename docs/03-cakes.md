Cakes are fabulous. Check out the pineapple one - my favourite.

## Dark Aniseed Cake
Dan Lepard

* 350ml boiling water
* 175g pitted prunes
* 225g black treacle
* 75g dark ale
* 175g unsalted butter
* 175g dark muscovado sugar
* 450g spelt flour
* 4 tsp baking powder
* 4 tsp aniseed (or fennel) seeds
* 250g icing sugar
* 3 tbsp orange juice
* Zest of 1 orange

Preheat the oven to 180°C. Line the base of a 20cm square tin with nonstick paper.
Pour the boiling water over the prunes, leave to soak for five minutes, then purée in a blender with the treacle and ale.
In a warm bowl, beat the butter and sugar until fluffy and pale, stopping the mixer from time to time to scrape down the sides and break up any hefty sugar lumps.
Slowly beat in the prune mixture until combined into a dark creamy liquid. Sieve the spelt to remove lumps, but add back any bran bits that get caught in the mesh.
Toss the baking powder and seeds through the flour, then beat evenly through the prune mixture.
Tip the mixture into the tin, smooth the top and bake for 50 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.
Cool in the tin, then transfer to a plate. Beat the icing sugar and orangey bits together, then spread this over the cake.

## Chocolate Guinness Cake
Nigella Lawson

For the Cake

* 250 millilitres guinness
* 250 grams unsalted butter
* 75 grams cocoa powder
* 400 grams caster sugar
* 142 ml sour cream
* 2 large eggs
* 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
* 275 grams plain flour
* 2½ teaspoons bicarbonate of soda

For the Topping

* 300 grams cream cheese
* 150 grams icing sugar
* 125 millilitres double cream (or whipping cream)

Preheat the oven to gas mark 4/180°C/350ºF, and butter and line a 23cm / 9 inch springform tin.
Pour the Guinness into a large wide saucepan, add the butter - in spoons or slices - and heat until the butter's melted, at which time you should whisk in the cocoa and sugar. Beat the sour cream with the eggs and vanilla and then pour into the brown, buttery, beery pan and finally whisk in the flour and bicarb.
Pour the cake batter into the greased and lined tin and bake for 45 minutes to an hour. Leave to cool completely in the tin on a cooling rack, as it is quite a damp cake.

When the cake's cold, sit it on a flat platter or cake stand and get on with the icing. Lightly whip the cream cheese until smooth, sieve over the icing sugar and then beat them both together. Or do this in a processor, putting the unsieved icing sugar in first and blitz to remove lumps before adding the cheese.
Add the cream and beat again until it makes a spreadable consistency. Ice the top of the black cake so that it resembles the frothy top of the famous pint.
