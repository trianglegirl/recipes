Slowly beat in the prune mixture until combined into a dark creamy liquid. Sieve the spelt to remove lumps, but add back any bran bits that get caught in the mesh. Toss the baking powder and seeds through the flour, then beat evenly through the prune mixture.

Pour the cake batter into the greased and lined tin and bake for 45 minutes to an hour. Leave to cool completely in the tin on a cooling rack, as it is quite a damp cake. When the cake’s cold, sit it on a flat platter or cake stand and get on with the icing. Lightly whip the cream cheese until smooth, sieve over the icing sugar and then beat them both together.

Ice the top of the black cake so that it resembles the frothy top of the famous pint. "],
