Dan Lepard

* 75g unsalted butter, softened
* 50g crunchy peanut butter
* 225g muscovado or dark molasses sugar
* 1 good tbsp black treacle or molasses
* Finely grated zest of 1 lemon
* 1 large egg
* 200g plain flour

* 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
* 175g salted peanuts

In a large mixing bowl, beat together the butter, peanut butter, sugar, treacle and lemon until smooth. Add the egg and beat in really well. Add the flour, cocoa and soda, mix until the soft dough is smooth, then stir in the peanuts.

Heat the oven to 180C and line a baking tray with foil or nonstick paper. Place round, teaspoon-sized balls of the dough on to the tray, spaced 5cm apart, and bake for 12-14 minutes, until puffed. Remove the tray from the oven and leave for five minutes to set slightly, then use a spatula to move the cookies to a wire rack or cold plate to cool.

## One A Day Cookies
Dan Lepard

* 125g unsalted butter, softened
* 100g (80) caster sugar
* 100g (80) soft muscovado sugar
* 1 large egg
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 100g wholemeal flour (bread flour ok)
* 150g lightly toasted seeds (pumpkin, sunflower and linseed. More sunflower than others)
* 100g good-quality rolled oats (not the stuff that resembles sawdust)

Toast seeds in a tray in the oven for about 8 minutes. 
Preheat the oven to 180C/360F/gas mark 5Â½. Beat together the butter and the two sugars, then add the egg and beat to combine. Stir in the vanilla, then lightly beat in the other ingredients.
Divide the mixture into 12-14 pieces (they should be roughly the size of a golf ball) and then flatten them a little with the palm of your hand as you lay out six pieces on a greased baking sheet. (You bake only six at a time because they cookies will spread out to twice their original diameter.)

Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the cookies are lightly brown at the edges.
Remove from the oven, leave to cool for a minute, then, using a spatula, carefully lift and transfer them to a cooling rack. Once cold, store in a paper bag or an airtight container.
