## Dark Aniseed Cake
Dan Lepard

* 350ml boiling water
* 175g pitted prunes
* 225g black treacle
* 75g dark ale
* 175g unsalted butter
* 175g dark muscovado sugar
* 450g spelt flour
* 4 tsp baking powder
* 4 tsp aniseed (or fennel) seeds
* 250g icing sugar
* 3 tbsp orange juice
* Zest of 1 orange

Preheat the oven to 180C. Line the base of a 20cm square tin with nonstick paper.
Pour the boiling water over the prunes, leave to soak for five minutes, then pur√©e in a blender with the treacle and ale.
In a warm bowl, beat the butter and sugar until fluffy and pale, stopping the mixer from time to time to scrape down the sides and break up any hefty sugar lumps.
Slowly beat in the prune mixture until combined into a dark creamy liquid. Sieve the spelt to remove lumps, but add back any bran bits that get caught in the mesh.
Toss the baking powder and seeds through the flour, then beat evenly through the prune mixture.
Tip the mixture into the tin, smooth the top and bake for 50 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.
Cool in the tin, then transfer to a plate. Beat the icing sugar and orangey bits together, then spread this over the cake.
