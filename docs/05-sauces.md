# Sauces

## Jumbo Chilli Sauce
Nigella Lawson

* 1 x 290 grams jar roasted peppers
* 3 red chillies
* 1 small clove garlic (peeled)
* zest of 1 lime (plus 1 tablespoon of the lime juice)
* 80g fresh coriander
* 2 tsp sea salt flakes
* 125 ml oil

Drain the jar of roasted peppers and put them into a food processor or into a bowl.
Take the stalks off the chillies, and deseed them if you donâ€™t like it really hot. Add to the processor or bowl.
Tip in the garlic clove, and lime zest and juice. Cut the stalks off the coriander and add these, too. Process or whiz with a stick blender until paste*like.
Add the coriander leaves and salt and process or blend again, then pour the oil down the funnel of the processor as the motor is running, or pour the oil into your bowl and whiz again with a stick blender. It will make a sauce that is more liquid than a salsa, but soft and spoonable rather than a pouring sauce.

## Peanut Sauce

* 140g smooth peanut sauce
* 1 clove of garlic
* 1 cm of ginger
* Juice of 1 lime
* 1 tsp tamari soy
* 1 tsp sesame oil
* 1 tsp sunflower oil
* 1/2 tsp brown sugar
* Drop of tabasco

Blend/chop ginger and garlic. Mix everything except peanut butter.
Add peanut butter spoon at a time, adding water if needed. Seal in glass jar and shake.

Add roasted peanuts and coconut milk to make it a satay sauce.
